2. Find top X accessed photos (file format could be gif,jpg, html)

#we can make use of --grep-- command and search for the required patterns in our file
#we can also make use of --cat-- command to display the contents of the file

#if we need to use the file command to try to recognize the type of file, regardless of filename (or extension).

#after setting up the vim editor pass the following code to get top X accessed photos

awk /path/to -regex ".*\.\(jpg\|gif\|html\)" > log


#we need to group our OR expression in escaped parentheses,otherwise the execution only  applies to the last part (i.e-html)
