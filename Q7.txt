#first we have to constrain within the given time period (in the format given in the log file)
to fetch the url missing within it

#by using grep we can search for the file of that particular pattern within the time format

#at first we create a file by the given command in the terminal

$chmod +x checkurls.sh

#we have also given the permission to execute the file

#inside the vim editor

#!/bin/bash

grep "09/Aug/2021:[11-20]:00:00" website

    urlstatus=$(curl -o /dev/null --silent --head --write-out '%{http_code}' "$url" )
    echo "$url" >> urlstatus.txt
done < $1



#Executed it from command line using the following -

$./checkurls.sh urls.txt
