3. Find No of referrers for a given IP

#for the number of referrers for a particular ip 
#web-server-->log directory

#grep--> searches the named input files. By default, grep prints the matching lines.
#cut --> removes sections from each line of files
#sort to “sort lines of text files”, with the flags:
#-n “compare according to string numerical value”
#-r “reverse the result of comparisons”
#uniq “report or omit repeated lines”, with flags:
#-c “prefix lines by the number of occurrences”
#less --> allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi
